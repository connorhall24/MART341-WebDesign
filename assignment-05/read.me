I visited myspace from 2001. That is the year I was born, and man has the internet come a long way since then. This page was very basic and looks primitive compared to the smooth webpages of today.
I learned a lot about how to make the words show up how I want on the page using headings and subheadings, page breaks and line breaks, and how to format paragraphs. I am having trouble with linking images though. I barely got it to work using markup in the read me file on the last assignment, and now I can't seem to get it to work.
