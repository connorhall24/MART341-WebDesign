I mostly come across forms in school, especially with online classes. Forms are how I take tests, do homework, and perform most of my meaningful tasks on the web
A text could be a prompt for a short answer question, a selection, like the dropdown, could be used to identify what state you live in, and a button input is how you would submit the form to its final destination.
This assignment was very last second for me this week, but I really like that we are starting to customize webpages in unique ways.
