      <p>About a month ago, bought this game for 3 bucks on sale, and I am very impressed by it. It looks good, and its pretty scary. I haven't ever played a horror video game before, and this is a great introduction into the genre. It comes with remakes of two different games, and they must be long games, cause I still haven't finished it. </p>
