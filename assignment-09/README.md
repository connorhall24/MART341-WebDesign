1. It was all new to me. I have the most difficulty with linking anything, whether it be webpages, my own pages, or pictures.
2. I am anxious to see the relationship between html and css and how to implement it right.
3. I was challenged with coming up with an idea, so I kept it simple. I was also challenged by just remembering all the different information from past weeks, like lists, forms, and how to set up an iframe.
