1. A system font is essentially an image of text, a web font is a custom font hosted on a server, and a web-safe font is a font that developers can count on working with all systems
2. Fallback fonts and font stacks are useful for if a device couldn't accept the default font, it will change to the fallback.
3. This week I had to deal with my parents coming up to visit, which took a bunch of my time up, and I didn't get around to doing my homework on time. I have it all finished and caught up now, but that was annoying.
