Each page has 1 head and 1 body element. The head will contain essentially all the background information and meta data about the website, while the body will contain what is presented to viewers
Structural markup sets up the architecture of the page, while the semantic markup can change how the text is displayed in that structure to enforce meanings of the text.
I had some challenges this week involving my new job. I started working at Frugal's and it has been good, but this past week our drive thru speaker broke and the General Manager quit, so it got pretty hectic. I think I did good, considering the circumstances. I just had to work harder and learn new positions quickly, and I am now almost fully trained.
